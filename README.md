### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

My first approach with coding was with VB.NET WinForms when I was in 8th grade ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜… And it's been a long way since then. 
I've had done some projects with C# ASP.NET, WinForms, etc. I've also used PHP, with frameworks such as Code Igniter and Laravel. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
* React
* NodeJS
* Non relational databases like MongoDB
