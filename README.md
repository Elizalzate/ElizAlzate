# Elízabeth Alzate Software developer
### Hi  👋

My first approach with coding was with VB.NET WinForms when I was in 8th grade 😂😅 And it's been a long way since then. 
I've had done some projects with C# ASP.NET, WinForms, etc. I've also used PHP, with frameworks such as Code Igniter and Laravel. 

Currently I'm working with .NET again, but this time with .NET core 5 and 6:)

## 🌳 I already have some experience working with:
* .NET Framework (WinForms, ASP.NET...)
* Relational databases (SQL Server, MySQL, Access...)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* React
* NodeJS
* Non relational databases like MongoDB
* .NET core (5 & 6)

## ⚡ Fun facts:
* Most of my experience has been in projects involving health care from medical records to prescriptions. 
* Before going into this career path I wanted to be a doctor or a pilot. 
* I love cats, if I had a bigger house I would adopt more.
* When I was in school I loved joining a lot of extracurriculars
