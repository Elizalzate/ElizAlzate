# Elízabeth Alzate Jr. Software developer
### Hi  👋

My first approach with coding was with VB.NET WinForms when I was in 8th grade 😂😅 And it's been a long way since then. 
I've had done some projects with C# ASP.NET, WinForms, etc. I've also used PHP, with frameworks such as Code Igniter and Laravel. 

Currently I'm working with .NET again, but this time with .NET core 5 :)

## 🌳 I already have some experience working with:
* .NET Framework (WinForms, ASP.NET...)
* Relational databases (SQL Server, MySQL, Access...)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* React
* NodeJS
* Non relational databases like MongoDB
* .NET core 

## 📫 How to reach me:

## 🗣️ Kinda fluent in 2 languages: 
* Spanish
* English
