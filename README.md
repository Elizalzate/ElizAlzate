# Elízabeth Alzate Software developer
### Hi  👋
 
I'm currently a software developer and QA, I'm also a Computers Engineering student at Nacional University of Colombia :) <br/>
Most of the experience I have is with .NET and relational databases such as SQL server, MySQL, etc. I've worked with other tools and languages like JavaScript, React, PHP and even Java. <br/>
Though I do enjoy learning and coding, I love spending my free time doing sports like Cheerleading (Yay! teamwork!) or just relaxing playing games, reading books, listening to music or playing with my cats.


## 🌳 I already have some experience working with:
* .NET Framework (WinForms, ASP.NET...)
* Relational databases (SQL Server, MySQL, Access...)

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* .NET core (5 & 6)
* QA concepts
* UI & API testing

## 🗣️ Kinda fluent in 2 languages: 
* Spanish 
* English
 
## ⚡ Fun facts:
* My first experiences were working in projects involving health care, like medical records and prescriptions. 
* Before going into this career path I wanted to be a doctor or a pilot. 
* I love cats, if I had a bigger house I would adopt more.
